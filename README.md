# cpanel_wordpress_troubleshooting
Bash scripts to analyze traffic and examine WordPress plugin usage for cpanel servers.

Not taking full credit for these scripts. I first read about the traffic.sh on a forum post that was explaining how these were used at inmotion hosting. Then I found the scripts in entirety here but poorly formatted. I've done some modifications and made sure these work.

You can read how they might be used from this forum post: https://www.serveradminz.com/blog/?p=867
